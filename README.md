# CS201 Computer Science I
University of Alaska Computer Science I

## Description
This course provided a broad overview of basic programing structures and best practices. Topics included 
algorithm development, structured programming, top-down design, good programming style, object-oriented programming and elementary data structures.
The course concluded in a group project where we constructed a terminal based calculator with various features such as, a token based interpreter, elementary root 
finding methods, and various combinatorial functions(Bell, Stirling, Combination, Permutation, K-list) with support for variable presicion arithmetic through the [GMP library](https://gmplib.org/).
